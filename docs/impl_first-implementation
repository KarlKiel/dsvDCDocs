## Your First vDC Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of your target device protocol (Hue, Sonos, etc.)
- TCP socket programming
- Protocol Buffer library for your language
- Understanding of property trees (see [Property System](./04-property-system.md))

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set up TCP Server**
   ```
   - Listen on port 8440 (default, configurable)
   - Handle incoming connections from vdSM
   - Implement protobuf message encoding/decoding
   ```

2. **Implement Session Lifecycle**
   ```
   - Handle HELLO handshake
   - Store session information
   - Handle BYE for cleanup
   - Implement PING/PONG keep-alive
   ```

3. **Announce Your vDC**
   ```
   - Create unique dSUID for your vDC
   - Send ANNOUNCE_VDC message
   - Populate vDC properties
   ```

4. **Announce Devices**
   ```
   - Discover/connect to external devices
   - Create unique dSUID for each device
   - Send ANNOUNCE_DEVICE for each
   - Build property tree for each device
   ```

5. **Implement Property Access**
   ```
   - Handle GetProperty requests
   - Respond with property values
   - Handle SetProperty requests
   - Send PushNotification for changes
   ```

6. **Implement Notifications**
   ```
   - Handle scene notifications
   - Handle channel/dimming notifications
   - Update external devices accordingly
   ```

7. **Enable Discovery**
   ```
   - Publish Avahi/mDNS service
   - Type: _ds-vdc._tcp
   - Port: 8440 (or your configured port)
   ```

### Minimal Example Flow

```python
# Pseudo-code for minimal vDC host

1. Start TCP server on port 8440

2. On connection from vdSM:
   - Receive HELLO message
   - Send HELLO response with vDC host dSUID
   
3. Announce vDC:
   - Create vDC with unique dSUID
   - Send ANNOUNCE_VDC message
   
4. Announce devices:
   - For each external device:
     - Create vdSD with unique dSUID
     - Send ANNOUNCE_DEVICE message
     
5. Handle requests:
   - On GetProperty: return property values from tree
   - On SetProperty: update device state
   - On Scene notifications: execute scene on device
   - Send PushNotification when device state changes
   
6. Keep connection alive:
   - Respond to PING with PONG
   - Handle BYE for clean shutdown
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to implement all message types?

A: No. Start with the basics:
- Hello handshake
- Announce vDC and devices
- GetProperty/SetProperty
- Basic scene notifications
- Ping/Pong

You can add more features incrementally.

### Q: How do I generate unique dSUIDs?

A: dSUIDs are derived from device identifiers. For virtual devices, you typically use UUID v5 with a namespace. See implementation guide for details.

### Q: What port should I use?

A: The default is 8440, but it's configurable via Avahi/mDNS announcement.

### Q: Do I need to implement discovery?

A: Yes, for automatic integration. Use Avahi/mDNS to advertise your service as `_ds-vdc._tcp`.

### Q: What programming languages are supported?

A: Any language with:
- TCP socket support
- Protocol Buffers support
- Preferably async I/O capabilities

Common choices: C++, Python, Node.js, Go, Java
