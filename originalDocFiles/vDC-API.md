Basics
1.1
Connection Management
• The VDC-API is based on Google protocol buffers.
• Transport level is a TCP socket connection, established by the vdSM to the vDC.
• The TCP stream consists of a 2-byte header containing the message length (16 bits, in network
byte order, maximum accepted length is 16384 bytes) followed by the protocol buffer message.
• The life time of the connection defines the vDC session. If the connection breaks, a new session
needs to be established.
1.2
Generic Response
In case of command failures the VDC returns a generic response message.
The errorType and userMessageToBeTranslated field are typically used to decide about program flow and
error recovery. The user message is suitable to be shown in user interfaces.
The code and description field are informational, and typically not designed to be shown to users.

Description
vDC
virtual device connector. A vDC is primarily a logical entity within the dS system
and has its own dSUID. A vDC connects to a Native IP Device or to a IP Gateway
with Native Gateway Connected Devices.
vDC host
network device offering a server socket for vdsm to connect to. One vDC host can
host multiple logical vDCs, if the host supports multiple device classes.
vDC session
logical connection between a vdSM and a vDC host (representing one or multiple
vDCs)
vdSM
virtual digitalSTROM Meter. A vdSM can connect to one or several vDC hosts to
connect one or several logical vDCs to the dS system.
vdSD
virtual digtalSTROM device. A vdSD represents a dS-Device system

Discovery
3.1
Requirements
• A vDC host must be discoverable by vdSMs automatically on a given network. Discovery must
work without any UI on the vDC host side.
• It must be avoided that a vdSM connects to a wrong (neighbour’s, for example) vDC host
3.2
Solution
• vDC hosts announce their services using Avahi (gnu implementation of Apple’s Bonjour)
• vdSMs look for available vDC hosts in the Avahi announcements and connect to at least one of
them. vDC hosts might reject connections if they are already connected to another vdSM.
• To avoid wrong connections, the vdSM which initiates a connection must be able to check possible
vDC announcements received via Avahi against an optional whitelist. If the whitelist exists, only
listed vDCs might be connected. The idea is that in small/simple installations connection is fully
automatic, but if conflicts arise in large setups (like show rooms or developer environments) these
can be solved by adding whitelists. Whitelists are located and maintained on the dss device.
3.3
Notes
• In a future version, the dSS configurator will provide a user interface to view and edit the whitelist.
• virtual device gateways productive with dSS version 1.9 currently have a vdsm of their own in the
gateway, which also announces itself via Avahi. This was required as a temporary solution, but
will be phased out with the next dSS version. For new developments, running vdSM instances on
devices other than a dSS is not allowed (nor needed) for production environments.
• The next planned version of the discovery mechanism will be smarter in avoiding duplicate con-
nections and keeping existing setup stable. It will also be able to seamlessly migrate now pro-
ductive virtual device gateways with a separate vdsm to using a dSS-hosted vdsm.
• vDC implementations adhering to 3.2 will continue to work as before.

Avahi service description files
• On a system with avahi-daemon installed, announcing services consists of creating .service files
and putting them into /etc/avahi/services
• The service types are chosen to be very unlikely to collide with other company’s services by us-
ing the ”ds-” prefix. If needed, dS service names could still be registered with IANA later (see
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6335.txt)
• The port numbers used below are just examples, actual ports might differ.
• The advertisment for vdSMs must contain a txt record specifying the vdsm’s dSUID
• Once dS services can handle ipv6, the ”protocol” attribute should be set to ”any”

vDC host session
4.1
Basics
• a session represents the connection from a single vdSM to a single vDC host (which may host one
or multiple logical vDCs)
• a session is identical with having a TCP connection.
• a vdSM aims to keep the vDC sessions active all the time.
• if a session is terminated for any reason, the vdSM must try to establish a new session.
• Only if fundamental incompatibility between vDC host and vdSM is detected (no common API ver-
sion), the vdSM might cease trying to establish a session..
• at a given time, a vdSM might have at most one single session with one particular vDC host (it may
of course have connections to multiple distinct vDC hosts).
• a vDC session must always start with a session initialisation phase, before it changes into the
operation phase.
4.2
vDC host Session initialisation
• vdSM connects to the vDC host
• vdSM calls ”Hello” method on vDC host.

4.3
vDC host Session operation
• session operation consists of announcing one or multiple logical vDCs (see below) and then an-
nouncing none, one or multiple vdSDs (see below).
• To avoid a vDC host session to implicitly end, some minimal communication must occur between
vdSM and vDC host in regular intervals (for example: ping/pong).

vDC Announcement
• after vDC session is established, the vDC host must announce every logical vDC it hosts, before it
announces any of that logical vDC’s devices.
• It does so by calling the ”announcevdc” method

vdSD Announcement host session
• for every vDC announced, the vDC must announce all device managed by the vDC.
• A device is considered managed by the vDC when the vDC has resonably reliable information that
the device is in fact connected to or connectable from the vDC. This means that the vDC should
announce devices even if the device is temporarily offline.
• The vdSM can explicitly request removal of managed devices

6.3
Ending Device Operation
• either vDC sends ”Vanish” notification to vdSM to indicate a device has been physically discon-
nected or unlearned (think: enOcean unidirectional switches for example) from the vDC.

• or vdSM calls ”remove” method on vDC to request a device to be removed from this vDC (but might
have been connected to another vDC in the meantime). vDC may reject removal only if it has 100%
knowledge the device is actually connected and operable (in which case the higher levels in dS
should see the device as active anyway and will not allow users to delete it)
Method

RESULT_FORBIDDEN:
vDC does not allow to remove the device, for example be-
cause it is verifiably physically connected to the vDC. However,
consider that for example wireless devices might get carried
away without being un-paired from their former vDC, and then
paired with another vDC in the same installation. In such a
case, dss/dsa will want to remove the device from the former
vDC/vdSM - the vDC must not reject such a deletion attempt.

Device and vDC Operation Methods and Notifications
• Note: the vDC host and every logical vDC have dSUIDs and can be addressed by some (not all) of
the device level methods, in particular reading and writing named properties for vDC configuration
and the presence polling method ping.
7.1
Named Property access
• Adressable entities are items within the vdc host that have their own dSUID. The dSUID can be
specified in vDC API request to specifically address the entity. The vDC host as a whole, the con-
tained vDC(s) and every virtual device has its own dSUID and thus is a addressable entity.
• Adressable entities have named properties which can be read and written by the vdSM and are in
some cases being pushed from the vDC.
• Properties that are defined in the digitalSTROM specifications (including this document) with
name, type and behaviour are considered system properties. Implementations conforming to the
specification must support these.
• Additionally, implementations might add implementation specific properties to extend functionality
beyond what the dS system demands. These properties’ names must always be prefixed by ”x-”.
It is further recommended to include an identifier for the party who introduces a property. For
example company Abc Inc. could prefix their properties with ”x-abc-”.
• Supported value types for properties are the simple types integer, double, boolean, string and
binary bytes, or a list of property elements which in turn contain a name (key) and either a simple
type (value), or yet another level of property elements. Note that while properties can be nested
indefinitely this way, it is explicitly recommended to keep nesting levels as low as possible.
• The available properties depend on the kind of the addressable entity (vdc, vdc host, virtual device)
- the complete set of properties supported by a virtual device entity is defined in the device profile
for that type of device.
• A common set of properties called common properties must be supported by all adressable en-
tities. These properties can be read to identify the type of entity, and get some basic information
for this.

7.1.1
Reading Property values
• Virtual devices can have zero to several buttons, binary (digital) inputs and sensors. The following
container properties provide access to the set of properties related to each input. The individual
subproperties are described in separate paragraphs further down.
Method
getProperty
vdSM -> vDC host
Request Parameter
Type
Description
dSUID
string of 34 hex charac-
ters (2*17)
The dSUID of the entity (device, vDC or vDC host) to read prop-
erties from
query
property elements sub-
messages
A property tree structure consisting of property elements, but
with no values, specifying the property or properties to be re-
turned.
• The name of each property element specifies a property
on that level to access.
• If the name is specified empty, this is a wildcard mean-
ing: all elements from that level (for example: all inputs
or all scenes) will be returned.
• If the empty name wildcard is the last element specified
in a query tree branch, this means all deeper levels of
that branch should be returned as well.
Response: ResponseGetProperty
properties
property elements sub-
messages
A property tree structure consisting of property elements and
values representing the properties selected by the query struc-
ture.
• The response has bascially the same tree structure as
the query.
• Where wildcards were used in the query, the response
tree will expand beyond the query structure returning
all substructures.
• Where
unknown/nonexisting
properties
were
re-
quested in the query, the response tree will not have a
corresponding element.
• Some properties might exist but not have a value at the
time of the query - these will return an explicit NULL
value.

Writing property values
Method
setProperty
vdSM -> vDC host
Request Parameter

Description
dSUID
string of 34 hex charac-
ters (2*17)
The dSUID of the entity (device, vDC or vDC host) to write prop-
erties to
properties
property elements sub-
messages
A property tree structure consisting of property elements and
values representing the properties to be written.
• The name of each property element specifies a property
on that level to access.
• If the name is specified empty, this is a wildcard mean-
ing all elements of that level (for example: all inputs or
all scenes) should be set to the same value.
Note:
channelState property must not be changed using setProperty,
but with the separate setOutputChannelValue action (see below)
Note:
if writing multiple property values in one request, failing to
write any of these will cause setProperty to return an error.
However, some of the other properties included in the same
request might already be stored (in any order, not necessarily
in the order of values as passed in properties). Use separate
reqests if you need separate ok/failure status for each value.
Response: GenericResponse

RESULT_INVALID_VALUE_TYPE:
passed type is wrong and cannot be written.
RESULT_FORBIDDEN:
the property exists but cannot be read (write-only, uncommon
case).
RESULT_NOT_FOUND:
the receiver (device or vDC itself) specified through dSUID is
unknown at the callee.
7.1.3
Getting notified of property value (changes)
• Some properties (especially button/input/sensor states) might change within the device and can
be reported to the dS system via pushProperty, avoiding the need for the vdSM to poll values.

Presence polling
• Presence polling is available for every addressable entity (vDC host, vDCs and all devices). Im-
plementation should return a pong only if the entity can be considered active in the system. If
possible at reasonable cost, a connection test with the device’s hardware should be made. In
some cases (unidirectional sensors) it might not be possible to query the device, in these cases
the vDC should apply reasonable heuristics to decide whether to report the device as active or
not.

Actions
• Actions are operations that may change the internal state of the device and/or its outputs, often
depending on preconditions, but do not cause a distinct change of a single status value that could
be read back.
• Distinct, unconditional state changes that can be read back are always implemented as properties,
not actions
