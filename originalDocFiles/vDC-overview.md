Description
(logical) vDC
virtual device connector. A vDC is primarily a logical entity within the
dS system and has its own dSUID. A vDC represents a type or class of
external devices.
vDC host
network device offering a server socket for vdsm to connect to. One vDC
host can host multiple logical vDCs, if the host supports multiple device
classes.
vdSM
virtual digitalSTROM Meter. A vdSM can connect to one or several vDC
hosts to connect one or several logical vDCs to the dS system.
vdSD
virtual digtalSTROM device. A vdSD represents a single device in the
dS system, and behaves like a real digitalSTROM terminal block (dSD,
digitalSTROM device)
vDC session
logical connection between a vdSM and a vDC host (representing one or
multiple vDCs)

Context
digitalSTROM virtual device containers (vDC) enable the integration of IP based devices into the digital-
STROM System similar to adding digitalSTROM terminal blocks (dSD) to the system. IP based devices
in the local network run a vDC to connect to the digitalSTROM System thru a virtual digitalSTROM Meter
(vdSM). A vDC can host multiple devices or device classes. A vDC is even suitable to integrate a gateway
to another bus- or network-technology e.g. enocean, dali asf.
3 different device types can be distinguished.
Figure 1: digitalSTROM vDC overview
2.1
device types
• device type 1 integrates devices thru the vDSM and the vDC running on the digitalSTROM Server
module of the digitalSTROM installation.
• device type 2 integrates devices thru the vdSM running on the digitalSTROM Server module of the
digitalSTROM installation. The vDC component is running on the physical device.
• device type 3 serves as a gateway to integrate multiple devices using bus- or network-technologies
like IP, Enocean, Zigbee, EEBUS etc.
Please get in touch with the digitalSTROM AG to define which device type is suitable for your product.

2.2
device detail
The effort to integrate devices is reduced to program the glue logic to connect the vDC API to the real
devices API. Currently there are two open source projects, libdsvdc and vdcd, both abstracting the vDC
API and offering a set of basic functionality which greatly reduces the effort to integrate devices. De-
pending on the type of device(s) to integrate, one or the other project might be more helpful.
• libdsvdc is a lightweight C library, targeted at device vdcs (device type 1+2)
• vdcd is a C++ framework designed primarily for gateway devices (device type 3) integrating entire
device classes with standard dS behaviour.

2.3
physical device OS
vDC is available for embedded linux. Running a vDC using another physical device OS is possible.
2.4
digitalSTROM configuration UI device representation
vDC’s are displayed in the UI together with dSM devices. A vDC has a (virtual) standard room where all
connected vdSD’s are shown initially. vdSD’s can be assigned to real rooms and behave exactly like real
digitalSTROM Terminal blocks.
2.5
Discovery
vDC hosts announce their services using Avahi (gnu implementation of Apple’s Bonjour)
vdSMs look for available vDC hosts in the Avahi announcements and connect to at least one of them.
vDC hosts might reject connections if they are already connected to another vdSM.
To avoid wrong connections, the vdSM which initiates a connection must be able to check possible vDC
announcements received via Avahi against an optional whitelist. If the whitelist exists, only listed vDCs
might be connected. The idea is that in small/simple installations connection is fully automatic, but
if conflicts arise in large setups (like show rooms or developer environments) these can be solved by
adding whitelists. Whitelists are located and maintained on the dss device.

Documentation And Sample Code
Documentation for the vDC API and the vDC API properties as well as this document is available on the
digitalSTROM developer website, and additionally on the digitalSTROM alliance website.
Sample code is available in the libdsvdc library repository and in a NetAtmo temperature sensor inte-
gration project.
